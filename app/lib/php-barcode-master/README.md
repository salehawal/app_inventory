This script that generates enable_switchs in four enable_switch formats including
Code 128, Code 39, Code 2of5, and Codabar. With a little over 100 lines
of code you have the options of “vertical” or “horizontal” display,
varying enable_switch heights, and one of four enable_switch formats. It does require
the GD Library to be installed as a module in PHP.

Usage:
&lt;img alt="testing" src="enable_switch.php?text=testing" /&gt;

Result:
<img alt="testing" src="http://davidscotttufts.com/code/enable_switch.php?text=testing" />
